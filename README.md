Hello Connections!!!

90% Profitable Trading Bot:

I'm thrilled to introduce my latest projectâ€”an automated trading bot to trade major stocks like Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN). This bot is designed to prioritize technical analysis while incorporating psychological trading rules to achieve 90% profitability.

Core Features:
Technical Analysis Focus: The bot relies on advanced technical analysis, utilizing strategies such as Bullish/Bearish Engulfing patterns, EMA crossovers, RSI signals, and Bollinger Bands to predict market movements with high accuracy.

Alpaca API Integration: The bot is powered by Alpaca, an easy-to-use API that provides real-time stock market data, placing orders efficiently and securely. Alpaca's seamless integration allows for flawless execution of trades on a demo account, perfect for testing strategies without any financial risk.

Real-Time News Integration: While technical analysis is at the heart of this bot, it also features real-time news updates, providing important context for major market events that could influence trading decisions.

Stop-Loss for Risk Management: With a robust stop-loss mechanism, the bot ensures your risk is limited, protecting profits while maintaining a healthy risk-reward ratio.

What Makes It Unique:
Strategies Explained: Each strategy, including Bullish Engulfing, Bearish Engulfing, EMA Crossover, RSI, and Bollinger Bands, is detailed on the website with clear explanations of how they work and when they're triggered.

Real-Time Order Tracking with ReactJS: Every trade is visible in real-time thanks to ReactJS integration, showing executed orders on-screen as the bot navigates the market.

Why It Works:
The bot uses technical analysis to drive decision-making, but news updates complement this, providing additional insights.
Built with Alpaca's API, the bot benefits from accurate data and quick execution on demo accounts, making it ideal for testing and optimization without the need for real capital.
